The pretraining consists of predicting the next [[Lexical analysis|token]] (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token.

These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including [[virtual assistant]]s, [[chatbots]], [[autonomous vehicles]], [[Video game console|game-playing systems]], and [[industrial robotics]]. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Poole |first1=David |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009258227 |title=Artificial Intelligence, Foundations of Computational Agents |last2=Mackworth |first2=Alan |date=2023 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-0092-5819-7 |edition=3rd |doi=10.1017/9781009258227 |access-date=5 October 2024 |archive-date=5 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241005165650/https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/artificial-intelligence/C113F6CE284AB00F5489EBA5A59B93B7#overview |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Russell |first1=Stuart |title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]] |last2=Norvig |first2=Peter |publisher=Pearson |date=2020 |isbn=978-0-1346-1099-3 |edition=4th}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-07-24 |title=Why agents are the next frontier of generative AI |url=https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai |access-date=2024-08-10 |website=McKinsey Digital |archive-date=3 October 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241003212335/https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/why-agents-are-the-next-frontier-of-generative-ai |url-status=live }}</ref>\n",

This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. [[Stuart J.

The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human [[Information processing (psychology)|information processing]] is easy to explain, human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to ''know what red looks like''.{{Sfnp|Dennett|1991}}\n",
